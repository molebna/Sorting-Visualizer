In this application you can see a control pannel and two data windows.
The first data window shows time complexity of current sorting algorithm and a randomly-generated array with 
a user-given array size and a range of values. 
The second data window shows a diagram made of those elements. When you start sorting columns move so you
can see the process. You can pause or stop sorting, change sorting speed. 
There is also an option to save current array into a file or restore the previous one. It can be helpful
when you want to sort the same array with different algorithms.
For the Bucket Sort user defines the number of buckets
